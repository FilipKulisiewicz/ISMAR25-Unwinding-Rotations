## Abstract 

Immersive telepresence, when a user views the video stream of a 360° camera in a remote environment using a Head Mounted Display (HMD), has great potential to improve the sense of being in a remote environment. In most cases of immersive robotic telepresence, the camera is mounted on a mobile robot which increases the portion of the environment that the remote user can explore. However, robot motions can induce unpleasant symptoms associated with Virtual Reality (VR) sickness, degrading the overall user experience. Previous research has shown that unwinding the rotations of the robot, that is, decoupling the rotations that the camera undergoes due to robot motions from what is seen by the user, can increase user comfort and reduce VR sickness. However, that work considered a virtual environment and a simulated robot. In this work, to test whether the same hypotheses hold when the video stream from a real camera is used, we carried out a user study (n=36) in which the unwinding rotations method was compared against coupled rotations in a task completed through a panoramic camera mounted on a robotic arm. Furthermore, within an inspection task which involved translations and rotations in three dimensions, we tested whether unwinding the robot rotations impacted the performance of users. The results show that the users found the unwinding rotations method to be more comfortable and preferable, and that a reduced level of VR sickness can be achieved without a significant impact on task performance.

This repository is also used to the thesis project. Topic: “Viewpoint Control Based on IMU for Immersive Telepresence Robots,” focused on viewpoint stabilization and suppression of robot-induced motion using IMU-based control.
